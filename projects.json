This lab has a recording data archive of hundreds of terabytes of data, previously only accessible slowly and with a cumbersome library, and only in short partial records. The CellTable creates large Pandas tables of neural data and second-level analysis features, combined across hours of continuous recordings, for approximately a thousand neurons per recording. Features include spatial and temporal analyses from the linear-nonlinear visual response model, spike correlations, mosaic analysis, and more. Recordings are summarized as \"median cells\" which enabled an across-dataset analysis of cell type variability.",

            "long_description": "In the vertebrate retina, the location of a neuronâ€™s receptive field (RF) in visual space closely corresponds to the physical location of synaptic input onto its dendrites, a relationship called the retinotopic map. We report the discovery of a systematic spatial offset between the ON and OFF receptive subfields in F-mini-ON retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Surprisingly, this property does not come from spatially-offset ON and OFF layer dendrites, but instead arises from a network of electrical synapses via gap junctions to RGCs of a different type, the F-mini-OFF. We show that the asymmetric morphology and connectivity of these RGCs can explain their RF offset, and we use a multi-cell model to explore the effects of receptive field offset on the precision of edge location representation in a population. This RGC network forms a novel electrical channel combining the ON and OFF feed-forward pathways within the output layer of the retina.",
