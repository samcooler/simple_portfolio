            <h2>CellTable and Retinal Ganglion Cell Type Analysis</h2>
            <div class="project-category">science</div>
            <p><strong>A neural data handling platform for large-scale retinal recordings.</strong></p>
            <p class="project-description">A neural data handling platform package written in Python for the Chichilnisky Lab at Stanford. This lab has a recording data archive of hundreds of terabytes of data, previously only accessible slowly and with a cumbersome library, and only in short partial records. The CellTable creates large Pandas tables of neural data and second-level analysis features, combined across hours of continuous recordings, for approximately a thousand neurons per recording. Features include spatial and temporal analyses from the linear-nonlinear visual response model, spike correlations, mosaic analysis, and more. Recordings are summarized as "median cells" which enabled an across-dataset analysis of cell type variability.</p>

            <p class="project-description">A field of 19 vertical steel poles, connected to the ground in a triangular grid with swivel joints and to each other at the top with elastic cords. Participants dance, lean, swing, sway, balance, and play with the poles, and through them and the web, each other. Strong enough to handle a dozen people playing at the same time. Features a custom PCB with an ESP32, accelerometer, and dozens of LEDs within a custom PETG printed housing at the top of each pole, in a complex module that enables pole rotation. LiPo batteries are housed within the poles.</p>

            <h2>F-mini ON and OFF Gap Junctions</h2>
            <div class="project-category">science</div>
            <p><strong>Discovered a connection between two types of retinal ganglion cells in the mouse.</strong></p>
            <p class="project-description">In the vertebrate retina, the location of a neuronâ€™s receptive field (RF) in visual space closely corresponds to the physical location of synaptic input onto its dendrites, a relationship called the retinotopic map. We report the discovery of a systematic spatial offset between the ON and OFF receptive subfields in F-mini-ON retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Surprisingly, this property does not come from spatially-offset ON and OFF layer dendrites, but instead arises from a network of electrical synapses via gap junctions to RGCs of a different type, the F-mini-OFF. We show that the asymmetric morphology and connectivity of these RGCs can explain their RF offset, and we use a multi-cell model to explore the effects of receptive field offset on the precision of edge location representation in a population. This RGC network forms a novel electrical channel combining the ON and OFF feed-forward pathways within the output layer of the retina.</p>
